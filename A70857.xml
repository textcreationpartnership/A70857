            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>In each of which we ſuppoſe ſomething pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative, and ſomething poſitive.</p>
                     <p n="1">1.

                     <p n="2">2.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:96470:37"/> do willingly dedicate and conſecrate themſelves to God.

Thus in the firſt place, to ſanctifie is to ſet apart, and dedicate to an holy uſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To ſanctifie, is to cleanſe, together with its poſitive act, to renew, endow, or adorn with grace: The <hi>privative</hi> part is <hi>cleanſing,</hi> the <hi>poſitive</hi> part is <hi>adorning.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, I ſhall conſider the privative part of Sanctification, as it is a cleanſing work.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. There is a new heart, that is conformity to Gods Nature, when the heart of man is like the heart of God, as <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to be a man after Gods own heart:<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note>

                     <p n="1">1. Faith Animates, enlivens and quickens the ſoul of man, it is ſuch a principle of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life, that a Believer doth not ſo much live, as Chriſt by faith lives in him. The ſpirit of Faith I am certain, if not faith it ſelf (which of all graces leads the <hi>Chorum)</hi> is the <hi>forma informans,</hi> whereby a man before both legally and morally dead, is now enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, and <hi>lives to God, Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. Our whole life here is a life of Faith, our life hereafter is a life of Viſion or Sight; here we <hi>walk by faith, and not by ſight,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.7. How ſweet and heavenly is that Life which is derived from, and maintained by the life of Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Faith purifies, where there is life there is motion; where faith is, there is purification. A Believer having a vital prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, like a living Fountain labours to work out the mud of ſin, to cleanſe and purge it ſelf from inward filthineſſe, ſo as not to approve it, allow it, or mingle with it, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving purified their hearts by faith;</hi> as ſickneſſe is poyſon to the blood and ſpirits, ſo is ſin to the ſoul; now as all the ſpirits in their natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tend to ſelf-preſervation, ſo the ſpirit of faith or the ſpirit by faith muſters together, and ſtirs up all the powers of the Inner-man for ſelf-pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, without purification there can be no preſervation, and Faith is the principal grace that purifies.</p>

Faith fructifies, a living faith is a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a fructifying or a fruit-bearing faith, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> demonſtrates, <hi>James</hi> 2.14, to the end.

How many Believers at large are there, that look green and fair, and make a brave flouriſh afar off, but come near them, and well obſerve them, view their hearts and their lives, or their hearts by their lives, and works, and you ſhall finde them like the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Fig-tree</hi> which <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſaw, full of leaves, but without fruit to relieve him in his hunger; the Curſe of barrenneſs will ſtrike to the hearts of ſuch Profeſſors, as it did to the heart of that Fig-tree.<note place="margin">Pſal. 36.9.
